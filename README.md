# Cuda-By-Example

## Requirements
To run the code you must have a working installation of:

1. CUDA
1. GLUT

## Run Instructions

run the bash script run.sh and pass the program number you want to run as a command line argument

Example to run 1_DeviceQuery.cu :

```bash
$ run.sh 1
```

## Limitations

Currently the codes are only tested on Linux but should work on Mac and Windows with manual compilation. Working on testing them on both platforms.
